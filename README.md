**Embodied Reinforcement IntelligenCe (ERIC)** is a framework that provides high-quality single-file implementations for finetuning vision-language-action (VLA) models via reinforcement learning. Following the design philosophy of [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl), ERIC is clean and simple, accelerating your research with user-friendly features. The highlight features of CleanRL are:
- ðŸ“œ Single-file implementation
